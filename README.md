FitbitPythonAPI
===============

Python client example accessing the Fitbit API using OAuth  

This is a working example as of 5/21/2014 that uses all current tools. 

It is based on https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/blob/master/docs/oauth1_workflow.rst and adds a few minor features (using existing tokens), fixes things that don't work, and gets data. 

You must first have a Fitbit device and account, and register for the API at Fitbit.com to get your Consumer/Client key
